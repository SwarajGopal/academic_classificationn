Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success


This project aims to build a predictive model to assess students' likelihood of dropping out and forecast their academic success. The dataset used is derived from a deep learning model trained on the original Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success dataset, but with slight variations in feature distributions. The goal is to explore how well the model can predict student outcomes and whether incorporating the original dataset can enhance the model's performance.
